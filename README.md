# desktop-config

I'm getting close to reinstall Fedora from scratch after a lot of years.
I think that maybe it could solve some issue, but I'm not sure it is more likely that what I'm experiencing is software bugs.

My desktop config files for backup.

My current "worth mentioning" desktop applications:
- File Explorer: Thunar
- Pictures: qView
- Videos: mpv
- Terminal: xfce4-terminal
- PDF: Firefox/Zathura
- Editor: Vim/VSCodium (even if I don't like it so much)
- Games: Steam, Heroic Launcher
