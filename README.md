# desktop-config

I use the i3wm spin of Fedora 42.

I don't like apps with a lot of dependencies.

My current "worth mentioning" desktop applications:
- PCManFM: file explorer, I also like Thunar but it has some issue (slow start at times, stupid dependencies like xfce panel);
- qView: lightweight image viewer;
- mpv: lightweight video player, it has some issue with 4k videos (enable GPU accel by default to solve);
- xfce4-terminal: I like this terminal more than others, it has tabs it is lightweigth, little dependencies;
- Firefox: I like it even if it isn't perfect, I use it also as a pdf viewer;
- Zathura: Alternative pdf viewer;
- Steam: it is Steam;
- Heroic Launcher: great for Epic Store, GOG and Amazon Prime games;
- OBS: I have a YouTube channel;
- Pavucontrol: control audio input and sources;
- KeePassXC: manage your password;
- Discord: chat with friends (video streaming lack some polish on Linux);

For HiDPI scaling (I use a 2160p) manually set the DPI scaling to 2 for GTK and QT apps, I find this to be the best.
