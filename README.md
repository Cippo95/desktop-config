# desktop-config

I use Fedora 41, the i3wm spin.

I usually don't like apps with a lot of dependencies.

My current "worth mentioning" desktop applications:
- Thunar: file explorer, I don't find that many file explorers are that good to be honest;
- qView: lightweight viewer, also in this case I don't like many viewers;
- mpv: lightweight video player, I really like it even if it isn't so good with 4K videos (it doesn't use hardware accel by default);
- xfce4-terminal: I like this terminal more than others, it has tabs it is lightweigth, little dependencies;
- Firefox: I like it even if it isn't perfect, I use it also as a pdf viewer;
- Zathura: Alternative pdf viewer;
- Steam: it is Steam;
- Heroic Launcher: great for Epic Store, GOG and Amazon Prime games;
- QtJackCtl
- OBS
- Pavucontrol
- KeePassXC
- Discord
